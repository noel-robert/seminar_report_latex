  abstract = {Recommender systems are programs that aim to provide personalized recommendations to users for specific items (e.g. music, books) in online sharing communities or on e-commerce sites. Collaborative filtering methods are important and widely accepted types of recommender systems that generate recommendations based on the ratings of like-minded users. On the other hand, these systems confront several inherent issues such as data sparsity and cold start problems, caused by fewer ratings against the unknowns that need to be predicted. Incorporating trust information into the collaborative filtering systems is an attractive approach to resolve these problems. In this paper, we present a model-based collaborative filtering method by applying a novel graph clustering algorithm and also considering trust statements. In the proposed method first of all, the problem space is represented as a graph and then a sparsest subgraph finding algorithm is applied on the graph to find the initial cluster centers. Then, the proposed graph clustering algorithm is performed to obtain the appropriate users/items clusters. Finally, the identified clusters are used as a set of neighbors to recommend unseen items to the current active user. Experimental results based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art recommender system methods.}

  abstract = {Uncovering the underlying community structure of a social network is an important task in social network analysis. To solve this problem, many community detection algorithms for the full topology of an original social network have been proposed. However, these algorithms are not very effective at analyzing large-scale social networks. To overcome this deficiency, this paper proposes a community detection algorithm based on graph compression. Specifically, a compressed graph is first obtained by iteratively merging vertices with a degree of 1 or 2 into their neighbors with a higher degree. Then, two indices, i.e., the density and quality of vertices, are defined to evaluate the probability of vertices as community seeds. By considering these two measures together, in a compressed social network, the number of communities and the corresponding initial community seeds are determined simultaneously. After obtaining the community structure of the compressed social network via seed expansion, the community results are propagated to the original social network. Extensive experiments conducted on various social networks have demonstrated the superiority of our proposal compared to several existing state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.}
